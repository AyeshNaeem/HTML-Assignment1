    <h1>My favourite colours</h1>
    <p>While I was fishing I looked up to the sky and <b>I discovered how beautiful the blue color</b>
         was. Since then, I have liked that color. It also makes me feel happy every time.</p>
        <p> I look at the sky at night, with all the beautiful
        stars. Blue means a lot to me, because it reminds me of the world.</p>
